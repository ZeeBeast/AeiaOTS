        v.1.01 - small fixes, optimized query + multiworld support.
        v 1.02 - now uses only one sql query, removed multiworld configurable  since it's not needed anymore

        This mod will clean houses of inactive players and move their items to the depot.
        
        config explained:
            
            days - If the player hasn't logged in for this number of days his house will be freed.
            log - true/false, whether to enable logging of which houses have been cleaned.
            file - path to the log file, where logs will be stored. Ignored if 'log' set to false
        
            DO NOT remove doSaveServer() at the end, otherwise if your server happens to crash before the nearest server save you will regret it =)
